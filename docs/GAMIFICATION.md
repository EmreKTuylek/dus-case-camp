# Gamification & Scoring System

DUS Case Camp uses a point-based system to encourage consistent participation and high-quality answers.

## Scoring Formula

The total points for a submission are calculated as follows:

```
Total Points = Base Points + Early Bird Bonus + Teacher Score Points
```

### 1. Base Points (+10)
Every valid video submission receives **10 points** just for participating.

### 2. Early Bird Bonus
- **+10 Points**: If submitted within the first **24 hours** of the week's start date.
- **+5 Points**: If submitted within the first **48 hours**.

### 3. Teacher Score Points
Teachers grade submissions on a scale of 0-100.
- **Points Awarded**: `Teacher Score * 0.5`
- *Example*: A score of 80 earns **40 points**.

## Leaderboards

### Weekly Leaderboard
